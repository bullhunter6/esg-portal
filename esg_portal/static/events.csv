Despite incremental improvements, residual concerns defined by the trilemma of insufficient range, slow charging times and high purchase costs are causing private buyers to hold off. An increasing breadth of product and a burgeoning secondhand market are so far delivering underwhelming results. Should OEMs continue to be 'all in' on EV, improving their offerings in the hope of imitating Tesla's success? Or should they balance their product portfolios by keeping a stake in legacy internal combustion engine and hybrid technology as well EV to navigate the trajectory of change? Will foreseen improvements in the holistic EV package reduce concerns around range and charging time quickly enough to prevent a swell of consumer discontent? Even then, will the deployment of the supporting charging infrastructure to deliver power needs in the public domain? Or could a lack of critical battery raw material availability derail the nascent industry just as economies of scale are in sight? These are just a few of the pertinent questions we will explore at this year's E-Mobility Innovation Day. Leveraging our proprietary technology research and recent consumer survey findings, our analysts will delve into the areas of battery, charging, propulsion, and thermal management, offering insights into the most pressing electrification technology challenges of 2024.
